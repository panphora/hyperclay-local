## Conclusion

The Hyperclay Local Electron app provides the **core malleable HTML functionality** but lacks most of the **platform features** that make hyperclay.com a complete web application hosting and development environment. 

Developers should expect to:
- Manually manage files and organization
- Handle their own backups and version control
- Use external tools for editing and development
- Forgo sharing and collaboration features
- Build their own asset management workflows

The local app is ideal for:
- ‚úÖ **Offline development** and testing
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-focused** app development  
- ‚úÖ **Learning** the malleable HTML concept
- ‚úÖ **Simple prototyping** without platform dependencies

For full-featured app development, hosting, and sharing, the complete hyperclay.com platform provides a much richer experience.
